#### Issue Summary

**Duration:** 2023-05-22 11:00 GMT+1 to 2023-05-22 15:30 GMT+1 (4.5 hours)

**Impact:** The company's e-commerce website experienced significant slowdowns and timeouts, with page load times exceeding 30 seconds in some cases. Approximately 60% of users were affected, leading to a sharp increase in abandoned shopping carts and lost sales.

**Root Cause:** The website's infrastructure was unable to handle the sudden spike in traffic during a major sales event, resulting in resource exhaustion and cascading failures.

#### Timeline

- **11:15 GMT+1:** Customers started reporting slow website performance and timeouts on social media and support channels.
- **11:30 GMT+1:** The monitoring system triggered alerts for high CPU and memory usage on the web servers.
- **12:00 GMT+1:** The incident was escalated to the DevOps team, and investigation efforts began.
- **12:30 GMT+1:** The team identified that the spike in traffic was overwhelming the web servers, causing resource exhaustion.
- **13:00 GMT+1:** The incident was further escalated to the senior engineering team for assistance.
- **13:45 GMT+1:** A temporary workaround was implemented by adding more web servers to the load balancer pool.
- **14:30 GMT+1:** The website's performance started to improve, but occasional timeouts were still occurring.
- **15:00 GMT+1:** Additional web servers and database replicas were provisioned to handle the increased load.
- **15:30 GMT+1:** The website's performance returned to normal levels, and the incident was resolved.

#### Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:** The website's infrastructure was unable to handle the sudden spike in traffic during a major sales event. The infrastructure was not designed to scale automatically, and the fixed number of web servers and database instances quickly became overwhelmed by the increased load, leading to resource exhaustion and cascading failures.

**Resolution:** To resolve the issue, additional web servers and database replicas were provisioned manually and added to the load balancer pool. This provided the necessary resources to handle the increased traffic and alleviated the resource exhaustion problem.

#### Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements and Fixes:**

1. Implement auto-scaling capabilities for web servers and databases to handle traffic spikes dynamically.
2. Increase the baseline infrastructure capacity to accommodate higher average traffic levels.
3. Optimize the website's performance and resource utilization through caching, code optimizations, and database indexing.
4. Implement traffic management strategies, such as rate limiting and load shedding, to protect against sudden traffic surges.

**Specific Tasks:**

1. **Set Up Auto-Scaling:**
    - Set up auto-scaling groups for web servers and databases with scaling policies based on CPU, memory, and network usage metrics.
2. **Increase Baseline Capacity:**
    - Increase the minimum number of web servers and database replicas to handle higher average traffic levels.
3. **Implement Caching:**
    - Implement server-side caching for frequently accessed data and static content.
4. **Optimize Database:**
    - Optimize database queries and add indexes to improve performance.
5. **Implement Traffic Management:**
    - Implement rate limiting and load shedding mechanisms to protect the website from traffic spikes beyond the infrastructure's capacity.
6. **Conduct Load Testing:**
    - Conduct load testing and performance testing to identify and fix any bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
7. **Update Procedures:**
    - Update the incident response and capacity planning procedures to include scalability considerations.
8. **Enhance Monitoring:**
    - Implement monitoring and alerting for auto-scaling events and resource utilization.
